     If the GPS Module starts to act weird make sure to uninstall pyserial and serial and re-install them
08/13/22 * The GPS receiver needs to be plugged in. if not there will be errors. 

To adjust the values of the gaige you will need to use the function provided in ** add location here**, and enter the samples that you take for each gauge and the according
voltage for each measurement. the function will return a function that you can copy and paste. as x you will provide the voltage that is
actually given bu the gauge and as a reault you will get the value that the gauge represents when given that voltage. 
you will need to this process for each one of the gaige that youra re using. 

for this project you will need a few component. 

1. red, white and green wire
2. dupont connectors and crimper
3. assortment of different crimp ends
4. arduino Mega
5. raspberry pi (other small computers will do)
6. buck converters 
7. voltage dividers. 
8. NA miata (pre obd2) cluster 
9. soldering iron
10.microscope or maginfying glass
11. assortment of resistors
12.portable monitor (compatible with #5)
